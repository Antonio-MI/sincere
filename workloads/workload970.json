    "prompt": "Describe a time when you had to make an important decision under pressure or uncertainty. How did you approach this situation, and what was the outcome?\nI once had to decide which candidate I should support in a tight election race with limited information available at the time. With so much on the line and so little certainty about either candidate's policies and character, I knew that my decision would have lasting consequences. To help me make an informed choice, I sought out opinions from friends who knew more about politics than me and relied heavily upon objective factual data provided by reliable sources. After careful consideration, I supported the candidate whose platform aligned most closely with mine regarding social justice issues as well as economic stability for all citizens regardless of income status or background.",
