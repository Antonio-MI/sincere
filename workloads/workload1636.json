    "prompt": "What are some strategies you can use to effectively write about complex subjects or ideas?\nTo break down complex ideas into manageable parts, consider using analogies or metaphors that help explain concepts in a more straightforward way. For example, instead of describing quantum mechanics in detail, you could compare it to the behavior of waves on a beach. This technique not only simplifies the explanation but also provides a memorable visual aid for understanding the subject matter.",
