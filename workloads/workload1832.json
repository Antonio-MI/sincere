    "prompt": "Describe the most challenging writing experience you've had.\nWhen I was working on my first novel, I encountered a significant challenge: creating realistic and engaging dialogue between my characters. I struggled to capture their voices accurately while keeping the conversations natural and flowy. After much research and practice, I discovered the power of using dialogue tags sparingly and letting the conversation unfold organically through character actions and reactions. This approach helped me create more believable and engaging dialogues that added depth to my story.",
