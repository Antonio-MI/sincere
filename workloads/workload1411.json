    "prompt": "Tell me about a time when you experienced failure but learned a valuable lesson from it.\nDuring my sophomore year in college, I applied for a competitive internship program with a prominent technology company, which required several stages of application including interviews and coding challenges. Although I spent months preparing for the application process and was confident about my skills, I failed to advance past the initial screening round.\nUpon receiving the news, I felt disappointed in myself, as I had put so much effort into preparing for this opportunity. However, instead of dwelling on my failure, I used it as an opportunity for self-reflection and growth. I realized that there were areas in which I needed improvement \u2013 specifically in communicating my technical expertise more effectively during interviews \u2013 and made a conscious effort to improve those skills moving forward.",
