    "prompt": "What are the pros and cons of using a digital camera over an analog one? Please provide specific examples for each.\nAnalog cameras have a warm, vintage aesthetic and allow for more artistic control due to manual settings. However, they require film processing, which can be costly and time-consuming. Digital cameras offer instant results, high resolution images, and easy sharing via email or social media. Yet, they often lack the authentic feel of analog photos and may suffer from over-processing if not used carefully.",
