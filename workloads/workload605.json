    "prompt": "Explain how the concept of free will relates to the idea that all events are predetermined by destiny or fate.\nFree will and predestination seem to be in conflict, but they can coexist in a way that allows for both concepts to be true at once. For example, imagine that you have made a choice between two possible paths on a journey \u2013 perhaps one path is more difficult than the other, but it may lead you towards greater personal growth and understanding. Even though your choice appears to be free, the events leading up to that point were likely predetermined by fate or destiny; nevertheless, you still had the ability to make an informed decision based on these circumstances.",
