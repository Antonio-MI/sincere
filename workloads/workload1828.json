    "prompt": "Write a story about how you once helped someone out in an unexpected situation. Make sure to describe what happened, how you felt during this experience, and the outcome.\nOne day while walking downtown, I encountered an elderly woman who had just dropped her wallet full of cash on the ground. Before I realized it, a crowd started gathering around us. Instinctively, I squatted down next to her and began picking up all the bills from the pavement. As I was collecting them, she expressed her gratitude by tearing up and hugging me tightly. I felt happy that I could help her out in such an unexpected situation. Afterwards, we both parted ways with smiles on our faces.",
