    "prompt": "Can you tell me about a specific example of when something did not go as planned and how you handled the situation?\nRecently, I had been working on an important project with a tight deadline. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, I found myself unable to complete it on time. Instead of panicking or making excuses, I took responsibility for my actions and contacted everyone involved in the project to inform them about the situation. We then worked together to find alternative solutions that would meet our objectives while still respecting the original deadline.",
