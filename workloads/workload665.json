    "prompt": "Compare two different styles of writing, such as poetry and prose, and discuss their differences in terms of form and content.\nPoetry is often characterized by its use of rhyme, meter, and imagery, while prose is more concerned with storytelling and narrative structure. Poetry tends to focus on emotions, ideas, and images, using figurative language and rhythmic patterns to create a poetic effect. Prose, on the other hand, is often more straightforward and focused on conveying a clear message or telling a story.",
