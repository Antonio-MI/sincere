    "prompt": "What is the best way to structure an argumentative essay?\nYour essay should begin by introducing the topic and explaining why it\u2019s important. Then present both sides of the issue clearly and fairly, giving enough background so that readers can understand them fully. After that, you need to make your case for one side over the other, using evidence from reliable sources whenever possible. Finally, end with a strong conclusion that summarizes your main points and leaves readers thinking about what they\u2019ve just read.",
