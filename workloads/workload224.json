    "prompt": "Describe how you would organize your day to maximize productivity and minimize distractions.\nTo optimize my daily routine and eliminate unnecessary disruptions, I start by listing all necessary tasks along with their respective deadlines on a digital planner app like Trello or Asana. Afterward, I block off specific time slots during which I focus exclusively on one task at a time without interruption. This way, I can maintain my concentration levels and prevent mental fatigue from setting in early. I also try to schedule challenging tasks earlier in the day when my energy levels tend to peak, leaving easier duties for later hours.",
