    "prompt": "Describe a real-life situation where you had to make a difficult decision under pressure. How did you approach the problem and what were the consequences of your choice?\nImagine you are a manager at a busy restaurant during peak hours, and you suddenly realize that one of the chefs has called in sick and left without notice. This means that there is now an additional station that needs to be staffed immediately. You know that if this station goes unstaffed, it will cause long wait times for customers, leading to dissatisfaction and possibly negative online reviews.\n\nTo make matters worse, you have only three available employees who can be trained on short notice: two servers who have some cooking experience from high school jobs, and one bartender with no kitchen experience whatsoever. The decision you must make is whether to train the inexperienced bartender or risk having long wait times and potentially losing customers due to delays at this crucial station.",
