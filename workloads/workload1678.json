    "prompt": "Describe a situation where you had to convince someone of something that they were initially skeptical about or resistant to. How did you approach this, and what was the outcome?\nI once had to persuade my best friend to try out an unfamiliar restaurant for our annual dinner date because her usual place was closed due to renovations. She had always been hesitant to try new places before, so I knew it would take some convincing. To win her over, I researched and found several reviews praising the menu variety at this particular eatery and pointed out that it boasted unique ambiance unlike anything either of us had ever experienced. Additionally, I mentioned how close by it was to our usual spot which made getting there easier than we thought. In the end, she agreed to give it a shot, and after enjoying ourselves immensely there, we now make this eatery our annual tradition instead!",
