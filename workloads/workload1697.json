    "prompt": "Please tell me about an experience you had that involved using creativity in a problem-solving context. Describe the problem and your solution, focusing on how your creativity helped resolve it.\nI recently encountered a challenge when designing an ad campaign for our company's newest product line: we needed to attract potential customers who were skeptical about our brand but open-minded towards innovative ideas. To tackle this issue, I decided to use creative thinking by brainstorming unconventional ways to capture their attention and spark interest in us. My solution involved creating a series of short videos featuring real people who had never heard of our company before yet were inspired after learning more about us and what sets us apart from others. These individuals shared personal stories related to the product line, highlighting its benefits while also adding a human touch that helped build trust with potential customers.",
