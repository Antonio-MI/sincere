    "prompt": "What is an example of a moral or ethical dilemma that you have faced in your personal life? How did you resolve it?\nRecently I found myself confronted with the decision whether to reveal sensitive information about one of my coworkers' behavior at work, which I felt could negatively affect his career prospects if made public. After much soul-searching, I ultimately decided not to share this information as doing so would violate my coworker's trust and confidentiality. Instead, I spoke privately with him about the situation and expressed my concerns directly. We were able to discuss the matter constructively and come up with a plan to address it going forward without compromising our professional relationship or damaging his reputation.",
