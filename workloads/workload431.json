    "prompt": "Tell me about a famous piece of artwork that you admire.\nI am particularly fond of the painting \"The Starry Night\" by Vincent van Gogh, which depicts the view from his asylum room window at night. The vibrant and expressive brushstrokes capture the swirling stars against the pitch-black sky, while the vivid yellows, blues, and reds evoke a sense of warmth and energy that resonates with me.",
