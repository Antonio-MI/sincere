    "prompt": "Compare and contrast two different writing styles that you find challenging to distinguish between when reading them.\nTwo difficult-to-distinguish writing styles are descriptive realism and impressionistic surrealism. Descriptive realism focuses on providing accurate, detailed descriptions of people, places, and events, while impressionistic surrealism emphasizes the emotional impact of scenes and situations through vivid imagery. In descriptive realism, authors aim for objectivity, striving to present facts without personal bias. By contrast, impressionistic surrealism often features dreamlike or fantastical elements that blur the lines between reality and fantasy. This creates a more subjective atmosphere where readers might question what is \u201ctrue\u201d versus merely imagined.",
