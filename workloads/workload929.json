    "prompt": "Imagine you are a high school student participating in a debate about the importance of literature. Your opponent argues that literature is outdated and irrelevant, citing the rise of digital media and technology. How would you respond to this argument?\nI would argue that literature remains as relevant today as it has ever been, despite the rise of digital media and technology. Literature allows us to explore human experiences and emotions in a way that no other form of media can match. It also encourages critical thinking and stimulates creativity. In response to the argument about digital media, I would point out that literature is not outdated but rather exists alongside other forms of media.
