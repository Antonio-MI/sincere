    "prompt": "Can you provide an example of a time when you faced a challenge that required creativity to solve? How did you approach the situation, and what was the outcome?\nI once worked on a marketing campaign where our budget was tight but we still needed to attract attention. I decided to use street art as a way to capture people's interest. I collaborated with local artists to create eye-catching murals in high-traffic areas, and also organized events around these art installations. This approach not only drew attention to our campaign but also fostered a sense of community engagement and appreciation for the arts.",
