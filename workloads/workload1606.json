    "prompt": "Describe a time when you had writer's block and how you overcame it.\nA few weeks ago, I found myself struggling to write an article on a new topic for my blog. After spending several days researching the subject matter and taking notes, I felt uninspired to translate all this information into a coherent narrative. At first, I tried to push through the block by setting strict deadlines for myself, but that only led to frustration as I couldn't seem to find the right words or structure for my piece. Eventually, I decided to take a break from writing and focus on other tasks related to my blog like updating my social media pages or reaching out to potential collaborators. After taking this breather, I came back to the article with fresh eyes and found myself able to tackle it much more easily than before.",
