    "prompt": "Give me an example of a time when you had to use your creativity at work to solve a problem.\nAt work, I once faced an issue where our team was struggling to meet our sales target for the month. To address this challenge, we decided to brainstorm creative solutions and eventually came up with the idea of hosting a charity event that would not only help us reach our goal but also give back to the community. Our event involved organizing various activities, such as a bake sale, raffle, and silent auction, all while engaging potential customers in a fun and meaningful way. As a result, we not only surpassed our sales target but also contributed positively to society.",
