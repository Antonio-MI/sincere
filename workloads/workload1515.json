    "prompt": "What are some examples of languages used for writing?\nWhen considering the use of languages for writing purposes, it's important to think about how each language might influence your message or story. For instance, English tends to be more direct and concise due to its predominantly left-branching structure; while Japanese can create a sense of depth because of its hierarchical syntax structure.
