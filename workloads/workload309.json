    "prompt": "What are some interesting facts about whales that you would like to know?\nWhales are magnificent marine mammals known for their immense size and intelligence. They belong to a group of animals called Cetaceans, which also includes dolphins, porpoises, and orcas. Whales are well-adapted swimmers capable of diving hundreds of meters deep into the ocean to feed on various marine creatures like fish, squids, and crustaceans. They have a unique ability to communicate with one another through complex sequences of sounds called songs or calls. These songs can travel long distances underwater and are used by whales for several purposes such as finding mates, navigating their environment, warning off predators, or signaling distress.",
