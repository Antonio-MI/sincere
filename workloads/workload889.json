    "prompt": "How can I improve my memory?\nTo improve your memory, it is important to focus on the subject matter when studying. Make sure you understand what you are learning so that it becomes easier for you to recall later on. Take regular breaks while studying and get enough sleep every night so that your brain has time to rest and recharge. Eat healthy foods rich in antioxidants like blueberries, strawberries, or spinach because these nutrients protect neurons from damage caused by oxidative stress which may impair memory performance.",
