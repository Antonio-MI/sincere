    "prompt": "Please tell me about a time when you had to work with someone who spoke another language, and what did you do to make it better?\nI once worked on a multinational team where several members only spoke English as a second language. To facilitate better communication, I made an effort to learn basic phrases in their native languages and used translation apps when necessary.
