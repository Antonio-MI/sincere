    "prompt": "What is an example of when you had to use your writing skills to persuade someone?\nIn high school, I was part of the debate team and often needed to write persuasive speeches to support our arguments during competitions. For instance, one time we had to argue against increasing the minimum wage. Although I personally believe in higher wages for workers, my speech focused on how such a policy could negatively impact businesses and potentially lead to job losses. By presenting this issue from a different angle, I was able to help our team win that round of debates.",
