    "prompt": "Describe the differences between casual and formal writing styles in an academic setting.\nIn an academic setting, the choice between casual and formal writing styles depends on the context and purpose of the assignment. Formal writing is typically reserved for more serious or professional settings like research papers, dissertations, or reports where clarity, precision, and objectivity are paramount. Casual writing, on the other hand, is often used in informal or conversational pieces such as blog posts, social media updates, or personal essays that prioritize subjective experiences and creative expression over strict adherence to conventions.",
