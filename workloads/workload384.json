    "prompt": "What is the purpose of a pre-exposure metering function in photography?\nIn photography, a pre-exposure metering function allows the photographer to manually set the exposure settings before taking a picture. This can be helpful when shooting in challenging lighting conditions, such as backlighting or underexposed scenes, where the camera's automatic setting might not produce accurate results. By using this feature, photographers have more control over how their images appear and can ensure that they capture the desired level of detail in both dark and bright areas of their images.",
