    "prompt": "Can you tell me about a time when you had to write a long essay on a subject you knew very little about? How did you approach this challenge?\nI once had to write an essay for my literature class on a postmodern author who was new to me. I didn't have any prior knowledge about the author or their work, so I approached this challenge by doing extensive research. I read critical analyses, interviews, and academic articles about the author, taking careful notes of key ideas, themes, and stylistic choices. Then, I organized my notes into a coherent outline, focusing on the most significant aspects of the author's work and how they contributed to postmodern literature. After completing the first draft, I revised it several times, checking for clarity, coherence, and adherence to academic writing standards. In the end, I submitted an essay that not only met the requirements but also demonstrated my understanding of the author's work and its significance in postmodern literature.",
