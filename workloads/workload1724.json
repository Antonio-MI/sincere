    "prompt": "Can you provide an example of a time when you had to make a difficult decision at work? What was the process you followed in making this decision?\nDuring my previous job as a project manager, I was faced with a challenging situation where we needed to choose between two different approaches for completing our project. Both options had their own advantages and disadvantages, but ultimately one would save us more time and resources while the other might result in higher quality outcomes. In order to make an informed decision, I first gathered all relevant information about each approach by consulting with subject matter experts, reviewing past experiences, and analyzing potential risks and benefits. Then I created a matrix showing side-by-side comparisons of both methods along various factors such as cost, timeline, scope, etc., which helped me visualize the trade-offs clearly. After careful consideration, I chose Option B because it aligned better with our overall goals while still being feasible within budget constraints.",
