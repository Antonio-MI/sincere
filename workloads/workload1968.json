    "prompt": "How would you describe the way in which I use commas in my writing? Is there a specific pattern I follow when using commas?\nI tend to use commas frequently throughout my writing, but I don't always follow traditional grammar rules. Sometimes I use them to separate items in a list, and other times I use them to set off phrases or clauses that function as appositives or adverbial clauses. For example:\n\u2022 \"I went to the store, and I bought apples, bananas, and oranges.\"\n\u2022 \"She loves him, not because he's wealthy, but because of his kind heart.\"",
