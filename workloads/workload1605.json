    "prompt": "Create a prompt for generating a short story about a supernatural being who has taken on human form and is living among us.\nWhen you meet someone new, how do you know if they are genuinely kind and caring or if they have hidden agendas? To illustrate this concept in the context of a supernatural being living among humans, consider the following scenario:\n\nA seemingly ordinary person named Jane has been living in your city for several years. However, Jane is actually an angel disguised as a human to learn about humanity and help those in need. Jane has been helping people behind the scenes, such as by saving them from accidents or guiding them through tough decisions. One day, Jane encounters you at a local coffee shop. What kind of interaction would happen between you and Jane, given that she is an angel disguised as a human? How would you react to Jane's unusual behavior or any hints about her supernatural identity?",
