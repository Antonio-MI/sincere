    "prompt": "Can you provide an example of a time when you used creativity to solve a problem? What did you do, and what was the outcome?\nI once needed to transport heavy equipment from one part of our warehouse to another, but the doors were too narrow for the items to pass through. To overcome this challenge, I came up with the idea of disassembling the equipment into smaller parts, carrying them individually, and then reassembling them at their new location. The outcome was successful, as we were able to move the equipment without damaging it or causing any delays.",
