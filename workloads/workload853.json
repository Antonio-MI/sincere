    "prompt": "Describe an event in which you felt strongly about something and acted upon it.\nLast month, I read a newspaper article about the plight of local wildlife due to pollution. Upon learning that there was a nearby river where people often dumped their trash and waste oil, I decided to take action. I gathered some like-minded neighbors and together we organized a cleanup event. We contacted the local government and received support in the form of supplies like gloves and bags for collecting trash. On the designated day, around 30 volunteers showed up and we worked together to clean up over 2 tons of litter from the riverbank. It felt great seeing how our community came together for a good cause and made such a positive difference.",
