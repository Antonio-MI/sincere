    "prompt": "Describe a situation in which you had to apply critical thinking skills to make a difficult decision. How did the process of critical thinking help you reach your conclusion?\nI had to determine whether or not I should accept an offer for a promotion at work. On one hand, accepting would mean taking on more responsibilities and earning a higher salary; on the other hand, declining would allow me to continue focusing on my current role while maintaining a better work-life balance. I considered various factors such as how much additional time I could devote to my new role without compromising performance in my existing one, whether the benefits of taking on more responsibilities outweighed potential drawbacks like increased stress levels and potential impact on personal relationships outside of work.",
