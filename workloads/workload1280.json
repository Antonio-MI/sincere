    "prompt": "What is one example of a time-management skill you can use at home?\nAt home, I can use the time-management skill of setting priorities to manage my daily tasks efficiently. This involves deciding which tasks to focus on first and which ones can be done later or even not at all. For example, if I have to do laundry, clean the house, and cook dinner, I would set cleaning the house as a lower priority than doing laundry and cooking dinner because those two tasks need to be done right away while cleaning the house can wait until later.",
