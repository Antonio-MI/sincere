    "prompt": "Explain how you would determine if a piece of text was written by a human or an artificial intelligence language model.\nTo accurately differentiate between human-generated and AI-written text, consider these factors:\n\n1. Semantic coherence: The text should maintain a consistent theme, message, or narrative flow throughout the entire piece of work. Incoherent or contradictory statements may indicate AI authorship, as language models struggle to comprehend subtleties and nuances in human conversations.\n2. Lexical richness: The choice of words used in the text should demonstrate a wide vocabulary range and complex sentence structures to convey ideas effectively. Simple, repetitive, or mechanical-sounding phrases may suggest AI authorship.\n3. Syntactic diversity: The structure of sentences and paragraphs should exhibit variety and creativity, reflecting human thought patterns. Lack of syntactic diversity could indicate AI authorship.\n4. Contextual awareness: The text should consider its audience, setting, and purpose in a holistic manner to convey its intended meaning accurately. Ignoring contextual cues may point towards AI authorship.\n5. Emotional resonance: Text should evoke emotions or create an emotional impact on the reader to engage them. Artificial intelligence often struggles with expressing emotions and may lack the necessary nuances, subtleties, and personal touch that human-written text has.",
