    "prompt": "Describe a situation where you had to balance multiple priorities and how you handled it.\nLast month at work, I found myself juggling several high-pressure projects simultaneously: writing reports for clients in different industries, preparing presentations for upcoming meetings, and coordinating logistics with suppliers regarding product delivery timelines. To maintain focus and avoid becoming overwhelmed by the demands of each task, I prioritized them based on urgency and deadlines, starting first with those due soonest. Throughout this process, I continuously updated my progress across all fronts via email or instant messaging to ensure transparency between stakeholders involved in these projects. By doing so, I successfully completed every assignment within the given time frames without compromising quality.",
