    "prompt": "Describe a recent event where you feel your communication skills have improved significantly.\nA couple of weeks ago, I had the opportunity to give a presentation about our latest marketing strategy in front of a large audience. I was initially nervous but focused on practicing my delivery and making sure I clearly articulated each point. The experience allowed me to develop better eye contact with the audience, control my nervousness, and deliver information confidently without using excessive filler words or repeating myself. I received positive feedback from attendees who found the presentation informative and engaging.",
