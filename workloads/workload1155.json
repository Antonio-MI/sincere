    "prompt": "Describe a scenario in which you had to create a compelling narrative around a product or service that did not have inherent interest, and how your writing skills helped you do so effectively.\nRecently I found myself tasked with writing marketing copy for an online course about personal finances. While the content itself is important and useful, it lacks the kind of inherent excitement that some products possess - making it more challenging to create an engaging narrative around it. Nevertheless, my goal was to write a compelling story about managing one's finances responsibly so as to make the subject interesting enough for potential customers to take notice.",
