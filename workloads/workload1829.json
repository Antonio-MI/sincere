    "prompt": "What do you think is the greatest benefit of using social media in your career? Please provide an example.\nI am an independent contractor specializing in digital marketing services for small businesses. Using social media allows me to easily reach out to potential clients who might not have otherwise known about my services or understood how they could benefit from them. I can create targeted content that speaks directly to my ideal audience and use platform features like hashtags, retweets/shares, and direct messages to build relationships with prospects over time. By maintaining an active online presence, I am able to stay top-of-mind for when people need what I offer, thereby increasing my chances of securing new contracts.",
