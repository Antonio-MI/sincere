    "prompt": "Please explain how artificial intelligence can be applied in solving mathematical problems, particularly those that are complex. Describe any specific techniques or applications of AI in this context.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has shown great promise in solving intricate and difficult mathematical issues. Some techniques include:\n1. Deep learning algorithms like neural networks to identify patterns within large data sets associated with complicated problems, making it easier for humans to understand and solve them.\n2. Machine learning applications that teach computers how to learn from examples provided by humans or other machines without needing explicit instructions.\n3. Automated theorem proving systems capable of verifying whether a given statement is valid according to specific rules set forth in a logical system; these have been instrumental in proving complex theorems previously out of reach due to their complexity.\n4. Optimization algorithms that can find optimal solutions for problems with multiple variables by searching through all possible combinations until an ideal solution is found; this technique has applications in areas such as supply chain management, logistics, and financial modeling.\n5. Natural language processing techniques that allow computers to understand and generate human-like text, enabling them to communicate mathematical concepts clearly and concisely.",
