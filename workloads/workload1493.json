    "prompt": "How can I make my text more engaging for readers?\nTo engage readers with your content, you should consider including images or videos related to the topic at hand; writing in a conversational tone that sounds like someone talking directly to them (as opposed to lecturing); and using active voice rather than passive voice. By doing so, it will be easier for people to connect with what they\u2019re reading and feel inspired to take action on whatever point you make.",
