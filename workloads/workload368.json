    "prompt": "What is a funny or amusing story from your childhood that still makes you smile today?\nAs a child, I remember how much I loved playing outside with my friends during the summers. We would often go to our local park and have picnics under the shade of old oak trees. One day, we discovered a hidden playground with slides made from the trunks of two enormous trees! We spent hours sliding down them and laughing at how fast and exhilarating it was. I still smile thinking about that day and how much fun we had!",
