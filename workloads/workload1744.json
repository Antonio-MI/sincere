    "prompt": "Please provide a detailed explanation of why you believe in global warming and its potential consequences for humanity.\nGlobal warming is a growing concern for our planet, as it signifies an increase in the average temperature of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and oceans. This phenomenon can be attributed to the greenhouse effect, where certain gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor trap heat from the sun and prevent it from escaping back into space. This accumulation of heat causes the temperature of our planet to rise, which in turn leads to various adverse effects on humanity and nature alike.",
