    "prompt": "What are some techniques used by writers to avoid plagiarism?\nAvoiding plagiarism is essential when writing any type of content. Plagiarism not only violates copyright laws but also damages the writer's credibility and reputation. To prevent plagiarism, writers can employ several strategies such as using quotation marks to distinguish direct quotes from their own original text; citing sources whenever necessary; paraphrasing information instead of copying it verbatim; writing in their unique voice that reflects their own thoughts and ideas; researching thoroughly before starting the draft process; taking notes on all relevant points during research so they don't forget anything important later on; using various writing tools like spell checkers, grammar checkers, plagiarism detectors etc., which help identify potential issues with copying or paraphrasing text from other sources.",
