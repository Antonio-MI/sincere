    "prompt": "Describe a memorable moment from your childhood that had a significant impact on your life.\nWhen I was eight years old, I attended the first day of school in a new city where I had just moved. I was nervous but excited to meet my new classmates and start learning about this unfamiliar place. One boy named Timmy befriended me right away and invited me to play after school. He showed me around his neighborhood and introduced me to other kids in the area. That day, I felt less lonely and more connected to my new environment.",
