    "prompt": "List an animal's typical behaviors.\nConsider the behavior of wolves, which are social animals that live in packs and exhibit complex social structures with clear hierarchies. Wolves rely on communication through body language and vocalizations, such as howling, to maintain contact with other pack members and coordinate hunting strategies. They are skilled hunters that often cooperate to take down large prey, exhibiting teamwork and coordination in the process. Wolves also exhibit play behavior, which helps them develop social skills, strengthen bonds with pack members, and alleviate stress.",
