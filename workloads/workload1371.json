    "prompt": "Describe a situation in which you had to balance multiple priorities at once. How did you handle this?\nI am currently juggling several projects simultaneously as an assistant manager at a retail store. I need to keep track of inventory levels, oversee team members' performance and training, ensure that customers receive excellent customer service, and handle any customer complaints or issues that arise while doing so. It can be challenging to manage all these tasks at once without losing focus on any area or missing deadlines for important tasks.",
