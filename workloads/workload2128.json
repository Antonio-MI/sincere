    "prompt": "What are the differences in how people use written language as compared to spoken language? Please provide examples for each.\nPeople tend to use written language more formally than spoken language due to its permanence and the ability to edit. For instance, when writing a formal letter or email, individuals often employ standard greetings, polite vocabulary, and clear grammar to convey their message effectively. In contrast, spoken language can be less formal and contain slang, colloquialisms, regional accents, and conversational fillers such as \"um\" or \"like\". For example, when speaking face-to-face with a friend, people may use more informal vocabulary and interruptions than when writing a professional report.",
