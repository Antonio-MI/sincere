    "prompt": "What is a significant event in your life that you feel had a major impact on you or others? Please describe the event in detail.\nIn college, I had an opportunity to study abroad in London for a semester. This experience changed my perspective about the world and myself in many ways. Living in another culture made me more aware of my own culture\u2019s strengths and weaknesses as well as those of other cultures. It also allowed me to meet new people from all over the globe which broadened my horizons immensely! I learned how to be independent and make decisions for myself without relying on others which was something I had not done before that experience. I made friendships with people who are now part of my life forever! All in all, studying abroad was a significant event in my life because it allowed me to grow both personally and professionally while having fun too!",
