    "prompt": "What would you do if you found a stray dog?\nWhile out on a walk in the park today, I encountered a lonely looking dog that appeared to be lost or abandoned. It seemed to be in poor health with a noticeable limp and an unkempt appearance. Upon observing its behavior, it seemed frightened and timid around other people or animals, suggesting that it might have been neglected for some time. Given the situation, I would like to help the dog by finding its owner or contacting the local animal shelter for assistance.",
