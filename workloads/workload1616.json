    "prompt": "What is the best way to start a conversation with someone you don't know well?\nWhen starting a conversation with someone unfamiliar, it's helpful to begin by introducing yourself briefly while also asking about something related yet non-personal (e.g., where they live). This will show interest in learning more about them without being intrusive or putting them on the spot. If possible, try finding common ground through shared experiences or mutual acquaintances - this can create an instant bond!",
