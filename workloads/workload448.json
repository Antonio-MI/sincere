    "prompt": "Describe the most memorable travel experience you've had in detail.\nOne of my most memorable travel experiences was when I backpacked through Europe for two months during college. While traveling, I visited over twelve countries and saw countless iconic landmarks such as the Colosseum in Rome, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. However, one experience that really stands out in my memory was when I went on a day-long hike through the Bavarian Alps, which included climbing up to the summit of Zugspitze mountain and then descending into a quaint village where I spent the night in an old-fashioned inn. The breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains, lush forests, and sparkling rivers combined with the sense of accomplishment and adventure made this one of my most unforgettable travel experiences.",
