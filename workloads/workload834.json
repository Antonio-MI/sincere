    "prompt": "Explain how the concept of \"flow\" can be applied to your work or a creative project you are involved with.\nFor my recent art project, I wanted to achieve a state of \"flow,\" where I could immerse myself fully in the creative process and let go of self-consciousness and distractions. I achieved this by setting up a dedicated workspace that was free of clutter and filled with natural light. I also made sure to have all the materials I needed within arm's reach so I wouldn't have to stop what I was doing to look for something. This allowed me to focus on my work and enter a state of flow where time seemed to vanish and I could create without any interruptions or self-conscious thoughts.",
