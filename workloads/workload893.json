    "prompt": "What are some benefits of reading books instead of watching movies?\nReading books has several advantages over watching movies. First, it allows readers to use their imaginations more fully since they create mental images based on the author\u2019s description rather than relying solely on visual cues from actors and directors. Secondly, reading can lead to better understanding of complex concepts as texts often contain more detailed information compared to films which must condense large amounts of plot into a shorter running time. Lastly, books provide opportunities for personal growth through learning about different cultures, perspectives, and ideas that may not be covered in movies.",
