    "prompt": "Describe how you would teach a beginner to ride a bicycle without training wheels.\nTo teach someone to ride a bicycle without training wheels, start by getting them comfortable with balancing on two wheels:\n1. Have them sit on the saddle and place both feet on the pedals. Explain that their legs should be slightly bent while sitting but not too much so they can still push down when needed.\n2. Show them how to use handlebars for steering and braking by turning left or right according to their desired direction of movement and gently squeezing levers located near each end of handles to apply pressure on brakes if necessary.\n3. Then, practice pedaling slowly at first, ensuring they don't go too fast initially to maintain balance. Gradually increase speed while encouraging them to keep practicing balancing.\n4. Once they feel confident in balancing and pedaling, introduce them to using the bike without support wheels: have them lift up one wheel off the ground and practice maintaining balance on just one side while continuing to pedal slowly.\n5. After mastering this skill, repeat the process for both wheels simultaneously. Eventually, they should be able to ride without any assistance.",
