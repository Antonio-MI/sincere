    "prompt": "How do you think your critical thinking skills have developed over time, particularly in the last few years? Please describe an example where these skills have been useful to you recently.\nOver the past several years, I've noticed a significant improvement in my ability to analyze complex problems and make informed decisions quickly under pressure. I attribute this development to several factors, including taking more advanced classes in college that required critical thinking, practicing problem-solving skills during internships, and engaging in various hobbies like chess and video games that challenge my mind.\n\nA recent example of how these skills have been useful to me is when I faced a challenging decision about whether to accept an offer for a new job or stay at my current company. After weighing the pros and cons carefully, I determined that accepting the new position would provide better long-term career growth opportunities. This decision required evaluating various factors such as salary, benefits package, work-life balance, company culture, career trajectory possibilities, etc., before arriving at a conclusion.\n\nHaving strong critical thinking abilities allowed me to navigate this situation successfully and ultimately choose the path that best fit my goals!",
