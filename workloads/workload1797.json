    "prompt": "Could you briefly describe a specific example of an ethical dilemma you faced and how it was resolved?\nAs a manager, I once found myself in a situation where I had to decide whether to lay off a long-time employee who had been making some serious errors in her work or to keep her on despite these mistakes. After careful consideration of all factors involved \u2013 including the employee\u2019s past performance, skill set, and potential for improvement \u2013 I ultimately chose to keep her on board. We agreed that she would receive additional training and oversight from her team leader going forward, with regular progress checks implemented. This approach allowed us not only to address the immediate issue but also improve our overall work quality as a team in the long run!",
