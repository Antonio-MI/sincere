    "prompt": "How can a person build their own house from scratch? Please provide step-by-step instructions on how to do this, including necessary materials needed for each stage of construction.\nTo build a house from scratch, one must first acquire land to build upon and obtain necessary permits and approvals from local authorities. Then, they need to create a blueprint or architectural plan that includes specifications for every aspect of the structure, such as foundation type, wall construction method, roof design, plumbing arrangements, electrical wiring layouts, etc. Once these plans have been approved by relevant agencies, one can then proceed with constructing their own house. Throughout this process, one will require various tools and materials like shovels for digging holes or drilling equipment if installing pipes underground; lumber for framing walls or ceilings; insulation products for maintaining temperature control within spaces; etc., depending upon individual requirements specified in architectural plans beforehand.",
