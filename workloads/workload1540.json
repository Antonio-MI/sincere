    "prompt": "Describe the process of growing tomatoes in a garden setting.\nGrowing tomatoes in a garden setting requires careful planning and execution. First, select a sunny location with well-drained soil. Prepare the bed by incorporating organic matter such as compost or manure. Plant tomato seeds or seedlings 1 to 2 feet apart and about 4 inches deep. Keep the plants evenly moistened, especially during fruiting stages.
