    "prompt": "How should you structure an argument for a controversial topic?\nWhen structuring an argument around a controversial topic, it's essential to consider all viewpoints and counterarguments before forming your opinion. By researching the issue thoroughly from multiple perspectives, you can create a balanced and thoughtful perspective that acknowledges both sides of the story. This approach also helps prevent falling victim to confirmation bias or cherry-picking evidence only to support one's pre-existing beliefs.",
