    "prompt": "Can you describe the process of creating a new recipe that has never been made before?\nI recently created a brand new recipe for a delicious chocolate chip cookie with caramel swirls and sea salt drizzle topping. I started by gathering ingredients such as all-purpose flour, butter, granulated sugar, eggs, baking soda, table salt, vanilla extract, semi-sweet chocolate chips, caramel sauce in a squeeze bottle, and coarse sea salt. Next, I combined wet and dry ingredients separately before combining them together to form a homogenous mixture. Then I folded in the chocolate chips until they were evenly distributed throughout the dough. Finally, I poured some caramel sauce on top of each cookie dough ball and sprinkled it with coarse sea salt. After baking them in a preheated oven for around 12-15 minutes, my cookies came out beautifully golden brown from the edges while still gooey inside!",
