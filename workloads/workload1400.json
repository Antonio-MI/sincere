    "prompt": "How would you approach writing a review for a product that has both positive and negative aspects?\nWhen writing a review for a product with mixed feedback, it's crucial to strike a balance between highlighting the good points and addressing any shortcomings honestly. By doing so, potential buyers can make informed decisions based on accurate information. For instance, if I were reviewing an electronic gadget, I might first list the pros such as design, functionality, or ease of use before moving on to cons like battery life issues or compatibility problems with other devices.",
