    "prompt": "How would you explain the concept of \"personal branding\" to someone who is unfamiliar with this term?\nPersonal branding refers to the process of crafting, managing, and promoting your own unique image and identity in order to stand out from others. It involves understanding what makes you special or different than others, and then using that information to create a cohesive message about who you are and what you stand for. Personal branding is important because it helps people understand what you're all about so that they can decide if they want to work with you or not.",
