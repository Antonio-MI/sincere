    "prompt": "Write a letter of complaint about a problem you had at a restaurant. How did the staff handle it and what was your reaction?\nDear [Restaurant Manager's Name],\nI am writing this letter to express my disappointment regarding the poor service that I received during my recent visit to your establishment. Despite having made reservations prior to our arrival, we were informed that our table would be ready in [Number] hours and not at the time stated on our reservation confirmation. This delay caused significant inconvenience for us as it meant waiting longer than expected for dinner with our friends.\nWhen I brought this issue up with one of your staff members, they apologized profusely but could not provide a satisfactory explanation for why this had happened. They did offer to compensate for the wait by providing complimentary drinks for everyone at the table, which was much appreciated. However, the overall atmosphere during our meal was less enjoyable due to the delay and disappointment caused by the lack of communication from your staff regarding our reservation.",
