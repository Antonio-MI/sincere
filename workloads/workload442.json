    "prompt": "Why do people use marijuana? What are its benefits?\nMarijuana has been used recreationally and medicinally for centuries. Its primary active compound is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which interacts with receptors in the human brain to produce psychoactive effects. Some reported benefits include relaxation, pain relief, appetite stimulation, stress reduction, and even potential anti-inflammatory properties. However, it's important to note that these substances may also have negative side effects if used irresponsibly or in large quantities.",
