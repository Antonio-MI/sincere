    "prompt": "Describe what a typical day for you as a freelance writer looks like. How do you structure your workday?\nA normal day for me would involve waking up around 7am after getting enough sleep the night before. I\u2019d then eat breakfast and check my emails to see if there are any urgent matters that need attending right away. After taking care of those, I'll prioritize my tasks based on deadlines or importance levels so I can work more efficiently throughout the day. This process helps keep me focused on what needs to be done first, second etc., making sure nothing falls through the cracks as a result. Once all major items have been tackled, I'd usually finish up around 6pm before taking time off again to relax with family/friends or simply recharge my batteries for another busy tomorrow!",
