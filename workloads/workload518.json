    "prompt": "What is the difference between a microcontroller and a microprocessor? How do they interact with one another during normal operation?\nA microcontroller is a compact computing device that often contains both a CPU (Central Processing Unit) and memory (such as RAM or ROM), all on a single integrated circuit. It usually has built-in peripherals like timers, counters, or I/O ports to interact with other devices in the system. A microprocessor, on the other hand, is a CPU that performs computations based on instructions from software or firmware. It typically requires external memory and peripherals to function properly.\n\nDuring normal operation, a microcontroller might use its built-in peripherals to manage and control various aspects of the system. For example, it could monitor sensors for temperature changes or control motor speeds. Meanwhile, a microprocessor would receive instructions from software or firmware running on external memory and then execute those instructions using its processing power.\n\nThe interaction between these two components often involves the microcontroller sending specific commands to the microprocessor through dedicated bus lines. The microprocessor then carries out the required computations before returning the results back to the microcontroller via these same bus lines. This way, the two components work together seamlessly to ensure proper system operation and functionality!",
