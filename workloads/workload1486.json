    "prompt": "Describe a memorable experience that you had working with a team on a project. What challenges did you face and how did your team overcome these obstacles?\nAs part of my last job at CompanyX, I was assigned to lead an internal research project for our marketing department. The goal was to understand customer behavior in social media platforms better so we could optimize our advertisements accordingly. My team consisted of six members: five data analysts and one graphic designer. During the early stages of this project, we faced several challenges such as gathering accurate data due to privacy regulations on certain social media sites like Facebook or Google+; managing large datasets effectively; interpreting complex analytical results accurately; and designing visually appealing charts that could convey our insights clearly. To address these issues, I worked closely with my team members to brainstorm solutions together. We decided to focus more on other platforms where data was accessible without privacy concerns (e.g., Twitter); hired a third-party firm specializing in social media analytics for technical support; created simplified summaries of complex analytical results; and designed minimalist yet visually appealing charts using flat colors instead of gradients, which made it easier to distinguish different types of information at a glance.",
