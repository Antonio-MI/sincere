    "prompt": "How would you describe the style or tone of a particular book that you've recently read?\nI just finished reading \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" by Douglas Adams. This humorous science fiction novel follows the misadventures of Earthling Arthur Dent who gets whisked off on an intergalactic journey with a friendly alien named Ford Prefect after Earth is destroyed by a Vogon high court. Throughout the story, I found myself laughing out loud at many cleverly written jokes and witty dialogues between characters.",
