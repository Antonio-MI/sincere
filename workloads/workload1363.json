    "prompt": "What are some interesting facts about the human body that you find fascinating?\nAs someone who has always been fascinated by biology, I am particularly drawn to learning more about how our bodies work and what makes us unique as human beings. Recently I watched a documentary on how humans can regenerate damaged tissues in certain parts of our anatomy like the liver or skin and it left me completely amazed at what we are capable of!
