    "prompt": "What is one specific example of when you had to think critically while solving a problem?\nWhen I was preparing for my high school graduation, I faced several challenges due to the global pandemic. Many graduation ceremonies were postponed or even canceled completely, leaving students like me without a proper farewell from our alma mater. After consulting with my friends and family members who had undergone similar experiences in their time, I came up with an idea: why not create an online community where students can gather virtually to celebrate their graduation together? I created a Facebook group called \"High School Graduates 2021\" where students could share their stories, memories, and achievements with others. The group quickly gained traction and became a popular place for students to connect with each other and commemorate their milestone.",
