    "prompt": "Explain the concept of anaphora and how it is used in literature. Provide examples of its use.\nAnaphora is a figure of speech that repeats a word or phrase at the beginning of successive sentences, clauses, or verses. This technique can emphasize key ideas, create rhythm, and enhance the overall flow of the text. Examples include Biblical texts like \"And Moses said unto the children of Israel...\"; literary works such as Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities where the phrase \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times\" recurs frequently throughout the novel.",
