    "prompt": "Describe a situation where you needed to use diplomacy in dealing with someone else's behavior or opinion. How did you handle it?\nI recently worked on a group project at university where one member consistently submitted their work late, causing delays for the rest of us. I knew confronting them directly would not help as they had personal issues affecting their productivity. Instead, I spoke with our professor privately and asked her to intervene gently but firmly by reminding them about deadlines and urging them to prioritize our group's success. Eventually, this person started submitting work on time without us having to ask again.",
