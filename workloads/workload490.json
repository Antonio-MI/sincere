    "prompt": "What are some ways to conserve water at home?\nConserving water at home can be done by fixing leaking faucets, using low-flow showerheads, and taking shorter showers. You should also consider collecting rainwater for your garden or washing machine and reducing the amount of water you use for irrigation purposes.
