    "prompt": "Explain the concept of time dilation in a simple way.\nTime dilation is an effect that can occur when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light. When this happens, time can appear to be moving slower for those objects than it does for observers not moving at such high speeds. This phenomenon is often described as \"time travel\" in science fiction stories, but it's important to note that real-life applications of time dilation are limited and primarily involve measuring tiny variations in the movement of atoms or photons.",
