    "prompt": "Differentiate between two terms that are similar in meaning but have distinct implications and usage patterns. Give examples to illustrate your point.\nThe terms \"data\" and \"information\" are often used interchangeably, but they actually refer to different concepts. Data is raw facts or statistics collected from various sources, such as databases, surveys, or experiments, whereas information is processed data that has been organized into a more accessible form with context added so it can be understood more easily by humans. To provide examples that illustrate this distinction, consider the following scenarios:\n\n\u2022 A company collects sales figures (data) for each product it sells every day at the end of business hours. After analyzing this data using statistical methods, management notices a pattern where one particular type of product consistently sells better than others during specific times of the year; they then decide to invest more in marketing campaigns targeting customers likely to buy that successful product in those seasons (information).\n\u2022 A researcher conducts experiments on laboratory animals and records their responses as numerical values (data). After interpreting these results with scientific knowledge, he finds that one particular type of animal exhibits behavior different from others under certain conditions; he then writes about this observation in his report along with its implications for understanding animal psychology better (information).",
