    "prompt": "Why are some people more prone to bioluminescent than others?\nBioluminescence is primarily controlled by genes, which means that certain genetic factors can influence how likely someone is to exhibit this trait. Some specific genes have been identified as contributing to the likelihood of bioluminescence, such as luciferase genes and other enzymes involved in the biochemical processes that generate light.",
