    "prompt": "How would you explain the concept of a \"negative space\" in art and design to a beginner?\nA negative space is an area within a composition where no visual elements are present. It can be thought of as the empty or blank areas around or between the positive elements, such as shapes, lines, colors, or textures. Negative spaces contribute significantly to the overall balance and harmony of a design by providing rest for the viewer's eyes and drawing attention towards important components.",
