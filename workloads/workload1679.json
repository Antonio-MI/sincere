    "prompt": "Describe a situation where you had to solve a problem creatively or unconventionally. How did you approach this, and what was the outcome?\nI once faced an issue of needing more space in my small apartment but having limited options available due to budget constraints and structural limitations. To find a solution, I decided to take advantage of vertical spaces by building shelves above doorways and other underutilized areas, thus maximizing storage capacity without adding new structures or spending too much money.",
