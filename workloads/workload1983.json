    "prompt": "What is an example of a difficult decision you had to make? Describe how it affected your life afterwards.\nAn example of a challenging decision I once faced was whether or not to accept a job offer from my former employer, even though it meant moving away from my hometown and leaving behind most of my family members. Although it was a tough choice to make at the time, I ultimately decided that the new opportunity would benefit my career growth significantly in the long run by exposing me to different environments and expanding my professional network outside of my comfort zone. This move allowed me to gain valuable experiences and connections that I might not have had otherwise, contributing positively towards both personal and professional development over time.",
